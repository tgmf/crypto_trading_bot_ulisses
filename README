# Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

A machine learning powered cryptocurrency trading bot focused on quantum-inspired probabilistic decision making.

## Overview

This project implements a sophisticated cryptocurrency trading system using Bayesian and quantum-inspired models to make probabilistic trading decisions. The system is designed with a focus on:

- Fee-aware model training and evaluation
- Probabilistic three-state decision making (long, short, no trade)
- Geometric market analysis
- Comprehensive risk management
- Realistic backtesting
